# DevelUp
When you are new to the tech world all you need is a good guidance. This world full of opportunities, full of scope also requires a lot of networking. And to achieve a great sense of knowledge, one needs to practice a lot in real life projects. So what better way there is to find a coding buddy who has the same interests as you do?
I made this project in a group of 4 for Tsec Hacks 2022.
